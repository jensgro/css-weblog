# Simple Starter-Kit for 11ty

This starter-template has little to no styling - on purpose. It assembles some clever solutions and basic structuring of an eleventy-site. It is a starter point with working Sass transforamtion and many more. But styling, structure and templating is individually. So this project stops before getting too much sold into designing.

The standard-language of the templates is set on German. Please change it in the data-file "metadata.json", when necessary.

The structure of the project was chosen after [watching a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boZiLtx8p3Q) by Jérôme Coupé, He wrote is thoughts down in a short and (in my view) important article: [Structuring Eleventy projects](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/eleventy-projects-structure/)

Some soultions like the shortcodes and some filters were taken from the great starter project [eleventy excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by  [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/).
## The variables in the frontmatter (or *.json)

- ``layout`` defines the used layout-file.
- ``title`` will become the page title and the content of ``h1``
- ``subline`` will become the subline (**optional**)
- ``permalink`` will overwrite the usual filename. This is an eleventy-variable.
- ``bodyClass`` will become the class of the ``body``-element
- ``eleventyNavigation`` has a least one attribute: ``key`` which sorts the page to a navigation category. A second possible option is ``order``. More about the navigation-plugin can be found [in the documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/).
